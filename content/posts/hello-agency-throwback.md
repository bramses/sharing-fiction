## git init -m "New Agency, who dis?"

It's been one full week since I started my agency, but I think I've learned more this week than I do in five regular ones. I'd like to take some time to discuss what I've learned so far.

## Battling Anxiety

I left my job [last July](https://usrbinblog.com/2019/06/next-steps/) to pursue entreprenuership full time. I left chasing a pipe dream in all honesty. I wanted a change in scenery, and more than that, I was desperate to succeed in my own endeavour. 

It turns out that this may *not* have been the wisest strategy.

### Wait, what am I doing?

My chief concern was that I actually had **no product**. I had a general idea, sure. I was going to produce content, and my overall goal was(is) to become a performing artist/writer. But! As reality has shown consistently in the past, it doesn't really care to mold to your aspirations.

My first endeavor was to create a podcast and a YouTube channel. I recorded six episodes of the podcast and then decided I didn't like that too much. It also turned out that I wasn't the biggest fan of editing videos. I found the process tedious, and while the end result was usually worth it, the process of `scripting > editing the script > recording n takes > editing for y hours > publishing by choosing a clickbaity title` pipeline took much too long.

Not to mention, YouTube is a **zero sum game** meaning that every creator on the platform is in direct competition with every other creator for viewer attention. The YouTube algorithm is a ruthless and efficent killing machine that regresses all content to a summation of watch time and how many people clicked on your brightly colored thumbnail (thanks evolution, you really got us on that one).

And I mean, sure, you could of course argue that my time on YouTube was my own fault, that I wasn't producing content that people **wanted** to watch. But hell, I liked what I was making! And to be honest, predicting that your video will be a viral success is like acurrately guessing if will will rain on Tuesday in Toamasina, Madagascar. You don't know. You think you might. But you don't.

From there, I went back to the drawing board. I tried the TikTok game for a bit, then I made some music. I streamed some algoraving content with Tidal and began writing more introspectively. All the while I was "digital nomading" and working on freelance contracts (which I'm **super** grateful for).

Around November-ish, I discovered a rabiit hole that may well be my salvation. [Creative coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding)!

### A New, Better Plan

As I mentioned above, I had played around with the idea of creative coding in the past by Algoraving with Tidal, but I didn't stick with it. This time was different, I told myself. I downloaded [Processing](https://processing.org/) and began to code.

As it turned out, I was pretty good at it! Or at least, not actively bad. 

This would lead to the first iteration of my agency. I messaged a few people I knew, testing the waters of feasibility for a creative code offering. 

### A New, Betterer Plan

Ok, here we go, v2, bigger, better, and this time with a profit model (lol).

Spark AR Studio came out of beta late last year. Since then, there has been a rush of creators to the platform, learning to create and distribute filters on Instagram.

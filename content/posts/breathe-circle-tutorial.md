Recently, I felt inspired by the [Calm Breathe Circle](https://www.calm.com/breathe) which is a really great, minimalistic tool. I re-created it in Spark while taking a few creative liberties.

You can try the finished filter out [here](https://instagram.com/a/r/?effect_id=221619535698652)!

## Mile High View

In order to bring this effect to life, we're going to need a few things:

- A circle (lol)
- An animation that causes said circle to expand and contract over time
- A few sounds to increase the immersion of the effect
- A dash of purple gradient to make the effect look cool, and emphasize the user's face

Here's our overall workspace:

Let's break each of these down!



## The Circle

The circle is the cornerstone of this effect. It is what the eye will be drawn to when someone uses the filter. In order to make the circle I just created a blue circle in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). I then took this circle and put it into [LunaPic](https://www10.lunapic.com/editor/?action=transparent) to make the background transparent. You can do that in Canva too, but I don't want to pay for the pro version ðŸ˜‰!

I then imported the circle into Spark and put it on a full screen rectangle.

Next, I extracted the `camera texture` to use as the `material` for the full screen rectangle.

Next, create a rectangle for the breathe material, and place it on top of the camera texture rectangle.

## Audio

To set up the audio, we need to do a few things:

- create an Audio player
- download some audio files
- use a controller to trigger sounds when called

I used two sounds in this effect: a looping rain sound, and a bell sound that triggers every time the circle hits it's smallest point.

### The Patch Controller

{{< figure src="/images/breathe-circle-tutorial/play-sound-mod.jpg" alt="Multi Controller" caption="Use a Multi Controller to trigger sounds" >}}

This part includes a bit of logic. We track how long the filter has been running with `Runtime`. We then use `modulo` and `less than` to send a `pulse` every time `runtime / 10 < 0.5`. This `pulse` triggers the `Multi-Clip Controller` and sends our Audio signal to our `speaker`. Neat!

## The Purple Gradient

In order to create the purple effect, we need to create a gradient patch and attach it to a material.

{{< figure src="/images/breathe-circle-tutorial/create-purple-gradient.jpg" alt="Gradient Patch" caption="Purple HAZE" >}}

To create the effect, we grab the `camera texture` from earlier by dragging it onto our patch editor. then we take a color `value` and `multiply` them together. Multiplying creates the cross between two textures. Next, multiply that by a `circular gradient`. This causes the effect to taper off towards the middle. Finally, route that into the `material` of the rectangle. Done! 


## Animation

I saved this part for last, since in all honesty, it's the most complex part of the workflow. While it's possible to create animations using the patch editor, I find it easier to use JavaScript directly.

Here are the steps:

1. Load in all required libraries from SparkAR
2. Find the `rectangle` that contains our transparent breathe circle
3. Get the `material` that holds the `opacity` of the effect
4. Set the parameters for the `time driver`, like how many times the animation should complete, how long it should take, etc.
5. Instantiate the `time driver` by using `Animation.timeDriver(inTimeDriverParameters)`
6. Set up a `sampler`. There are many different options you can use to mess with the easing of the animation (how fast it goes in/out). For this animation, I'm using `easeInOutQuad()` which mimics the human lungs. They quickly expand or deflate, and taper off as they get close to full or empty.
7. Combine the `time driver` and the `sampler` by using the `Animation.animate()` method
8. Modify the scale (the size) of our circle as the animation moves along. The first variable is x and the second is y
9. Same as #6-8 for the `opacity` of the material. Controls the "blueness" of the effect
10. Start the animation using `timeDriver.start()`!

Below is the full code excerpt :)

```javascript
// 1.
const Animation = require('Animation'); // to control circle movement
const Scene = require('Scene'); // so we can get "child" objects in the scene
export const Diagnostics = require('Diagnostics'); // so we can log our results to the console
const Materials = require('Materials'); // so we can edit the opacity of the circle

// 2.
const breathCircle = Scene.root.find('breatheCircle');

// 3.
const breatheMat = Materials.get('material0');


// 4.
const inTimeDriverParameters = {

    // The duration of the driver
    durationMilliseconds: 5000,
  
    // The number of iterations before the driver stops
    loopCount: Infinity,
  
    // Should the driver 'yoyo' back and forth
    mirror: true

};

// 5.
const inTimeDriver = Animation.timeDriver(inTimeDriverParameters);

// 6. 
const inQuadraticSampler = Animation.samplers.easeInOutQuad(1.2, 3.9);

// 7.
const inTranslationAnimation = Animation.animate(inTimeDriver, inQuadraticSampler);

// 8.
breathCircle.transform.scaleX = inTranslationAnimation;
breathCircle.transform.scaleY = inTranslationAnimation;

// 9.
const opacityLinearSampler = Animation.samplers.linear(0.2, 0.95);
const opacityAnimation = Animation.animate(inTimeDriver, opacityLinearSampler);
breatheMat.opacity = opacityAnimation;

// 10.
inTimeDriver.start();
```

## Conclusion

And that's it! Thanks for reading, and have fun making filters.

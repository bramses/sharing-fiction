## This week:

- Two Tutorials
- Collaborations [Vivid Limbo & Luke Metzler]
- One Month Thoughts; What Did Sharing Fiction Achieve?
- Where to Next Month?


## Two-torials

They say the best way to learn is through teaching. I don’t know if I fully agree with that sentiment, but it is nice to revisit concepts at least.

Choosing what’s worth teaching is such a personal decision. You want to teach something that is interesting to a reader. Interesting !== trivial, but it doesn’t mean choosing an overly complex topic either. In the end, I chose to make the tutorials about two filters that I had fun making and learned something new while doing. 

You can read the tutorial on the Breathe Filter [here](https://www.sharingfiction.com/posts/breathe-circle-tutorial/) and the Infinity Stones filter [here](https://www.sharingfiction.com/posts/infinity-stones-tutorial/).

## Wanna Collab, Bro?

I took a hint from the music production industry and decided it would be a good idea for the agency to do some collabs. I wanted to get testimonials and get people aware of what Sharing Fiction offers, and gain some “on the field” experience. I decided to reach out to artists/entrepreneurs and ask them if I could make filters that represent their personalities. Fortunately I have two very talented friends who fit that bill perfectly: [Luke Metzler](https://www.instagram.com/luke_metzler/) and [Dan Hargrove](https://www.instagram.com/vividlimbo/) who make cool stuff worth celebrating. 

For Dan, I made a filter that takes the layers of one of his Procreate paintings and splits it into 3D space. I’m really excited to continue working with Dan and turn his art into a more interactive experience. He also wants to sell prints so hopefully this type of work incentivizes people to buy his work.

For Luke, I made a filter that relates to his relationship with Marvel. Last year, Luke made a video that parodied Old Town Road and Avengers called *Old Town Road*. As of April 2020, the video has 30 million views. I’m also a big fan of Avengers as well so it was fun to come up with a filter idea that could represent the series.

## One Month Down

A month ago, I started Sharing Fiction with a simple dream: **run a creative marketing agency**. 

A month later; I bought a domain, a Hugo site, and I did some stuff on Netlify to bring this site to life. I made a few filters and wrote some words. I had a few meetings with potential customers, sent some cold outreach emails, and did collaborations with inspiring people. 

I wonder if this month would’ve gone differently if coronavirus wasn’t ravaging society, but it’s really impossible to know how things would have played out differently. I made a lot of mistakes, but I’m glad that I was able to commit to a business plan and trial it. 

**Business is a science** and I still stand by what I said during the first week:

> “You don’t need to be the best when just getting started. Learning is a part of business.”


## Where To Next Month?

For month two, I gave myself the goal to close a client, learn what trends are popular (in order to make filters that have a better chance of spreading), and to nail the habit of a “workday” even though I work for myself.

[Iman Gadzhi](https://youtu.be/wtyuUMhOpDY?t=669) has mentioned that the main challenge of running a business is the routines that one has to implement to grow the business. These challenges are internal: waking up at the same time, eating healthy foods, avoiding social media and procrastination, etc. 

> “People think they need the information...they think that once I just get this secret hack...everything will be good...It doesn’t matter what you learn...if you don’t get past your own mental blocks.” -Iman Gadzhi

## AR Learnings

- The 3D space can give 2D work a new, and very cool, angle. Use the `3D Animated Poster` template to bring your projects to life!
- When using the [Native UI Picker](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/documentation/reference/classes/nativeuimodule.picker/) make sure to put **all** the assets you plan on using in the `Promise.all()`. This will guarantee that they will be ready when a user clicks a button.
- Spotlights can generate really cool effects when attached to “virtual dollies”. Use an `animation` to make them move across the user’s face.

### Projects Completed

## A-Ha Business Moments

- You will be remembered for your contributions, not your person.
- What gaps in your thinking can you address? What [cognitive biases](https://medium.com/thinking-is-hard/4-conundrums-of-intelligence-2ab78d90740f) are most prevalent in your life?
- You have to **want** something to achieve it. That’s not *want* with a lower case “w” (imitative wants are what you want because **other** people have them; ex. New car, new house, etc.). You need the capital “W” want; something you’ll pursue past the point of rationality, something you desire so bad the pain is merely a tradeoff.

See y’all in month two. Thanks for reading.

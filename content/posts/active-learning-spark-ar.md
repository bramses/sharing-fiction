Learning SparkAR Studio has been a fun and fruitful journey. The software is quite intuitive, but includes a lot of depth as well that you don't notice at first glance. The internet is pretty sparse in educational material about it, and the current content is repetitive since there is no centralized source of knowledge.

## Wait... no centralized source? What about the Spark AR Docs from Facebook?

Unfortunately, as of March 2020, the Spark AR website is hard to manage/manauver around. The tutorials, while helpful, share no common thread, and most of them teach a bunch of random things en route to creating a filter example. 

## Learn by Doing

I feel that SparkAR follows a similar model to learning programming. Sure, you can learn to program by creating for loops and Python classes, but this is inefficent. Learning programming isn't a mechanical skill like mastering a tennis swing. It's a means to an end. We learn to program to communicate to computers, which allows us to create our goals of creating fun and useful programs.

## Masterful Googling

Let me let you in on a secret **all** software engineers share. Our main skill stack isn't programming, it's **asking the right questions**. There's a joke I once heard back at school: "My degree says I only majored in CS, but I actually got a double major in Googling."
